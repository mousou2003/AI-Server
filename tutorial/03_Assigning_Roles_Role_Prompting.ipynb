    "# Chapter 3 — Prompt Modes: System vs Role vs Instructions vs Style\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook teaches how different *prompt modes* shape an LLM’s output and gives hands-on exercises. We will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **System Prompt** — the default behavior / ground rules.\n",
    "2. **Role Prompt** — the persona or hat worn for a given task.\n",
    "3. **Instructions** — the specific command for the task at hand.\n",
    "4. **Style** — tone and formatting.\n",
    "5. **Mixed Frames** — combining modes for precise control.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Learning Goal**: By the end, you can design prompts that reliably change tone, depth, and format and you’ll have mini-exercises to practice each concept.\n"

    "A system prompt sets the default behavior, but a specific user instruction or role prompt can override it.
