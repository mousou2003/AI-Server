      "  Content: Making a perfect omelette involves several key steps. Here's a simple recipe to help you create an excellent omelette:\n",
      "\n",
      "Ingredients:\n",
      "- 2 eggs (or more, depending on your preference)\n",
      "- Salt and pepper to taste\n",
      "- 1 tablespoon of butter or oil\n",
      "- Optional fillings: cheese, diced ham, chopped vegetables, herbs, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Crack the eggs into a bowl and beat them with a fork until the yolks and whites are fully combined.\n",
      "2. Season the beaten eggs with salt and pepper to taste.\n",
      "3. Heat a non-stick skillet or frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil. Swirl it around to coat the bottom of the pan evenly.\n",
      "4. Once the butter has melted and is foaming (or the oil is hot), pour in the beaten eggs. Let them cook for about 10-20 seconds, then use a spatula to gently push the cooked edges towards the center while tilting the pan to allow the uncooked egg to flow to the edges.\n",
      "5. If using fillings, add them now on one side of the omelette and sprinkle cheese over it if desired.\n",
      "6. Once the eggs are mostly set but still slightly runny on top (usually after about 1-2 minutes), use a spatula to fold the omelette in half over the filling.\n",
      "7. Cook for another 30 seconds or so, until the cheese is melted and the eggs are fully cooked to your liking.\n",
      "8. Slide the omelette onto a plate and serve immediately.\n",
      "\n",

      "### Ingredients:\n",
      "- 2 large eggs (or 3 for a larger omelette)\n",
      "- Salt and pepper to taste\n",
      "- A small knob of butter or olive oil\n",
      "- Optional fillings: cheese, herbs, diced vegetables, cooked meats, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Equipment:\n",
      "- Non-stick skillet or frying pan (about 8 inches in diameter is ideal)\n",
      "- Whisk or fork for beating eggs\n",
      "- Spatula\n",
      "\n",
      "### Instructions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Prepare the Eggs**:\n",
      "   - Crack the eggs into a bowl and beat them with salt and pepper until well combined. You can add a splash of milk or cream to make it extra fluffy, but this is optional.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Heat the Pan**:\n",
      "   - Place your non-stick skillet over medium heat and let it warm up for about 1-2 minutes.\n",
      "   - Add a small knob of butter (about half a tablespoon) or a teaspoon of olive oil to the pan. Let it melt and spread evenly across the surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cook the Eggs**:\n",
      "   - Pour in the beaten eggs into the center of the hot, greased skillet.\n",
      "   - As soon as the edges start to set but before they become too firm (about 15-20 seconds), use a spatula to gently push them towards the center while tilting the pan to allow any uncooked egg from the edge to flow to the sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Add Fillings**:\n",
      "   - Once you have a nice layer of cooked eggs on one side, add your fillings (cheese, herbs, vegetables, etc.) along one half of the omelette.\n",
      "   - Sprinkle some cheese over the filling if using it for extra flavor and texture.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Fold the Omelette**:\n",
      "   - Once the top surface is just set but still slightly runny, use your spatula to fold the empty side of the omelette over the filled half.\n",
      "   - Let it cook for another 10-20 seconds until the cheese melts and everything is heated through.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Serve Hot**:\n",
      "   - Slide the folded omelette onto a plate using your spatula, making sure not to break its shape.\n",
      "   - Serve immediately while hot and enjoy!\n",
      "\n",
      "### Tips:\n",
      "- Use room temperature eggs for better results.\n",
      "- Don’t overcook; an omelette should be slightly runny inside when you fold it.\n",
      "- Experiment with different fillings based on what you have available or your personal taste preferences.\n",
